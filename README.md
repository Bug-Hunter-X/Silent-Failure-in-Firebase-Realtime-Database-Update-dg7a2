# Silent Failure in Firebase Realtime Database Update

This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase applications where database updates fail silently due to a missing error-handling mechanism.  The `bug.js` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.

## Problem
The original code lacks a `.catch` block to handle potential errors during a Firebase Realtime Database update operation. This results in silent failures, making it difficult to debug and potentially leading to inconsistent application state.

## Solution
The solution incorporates a `.catch` block to handle potential errors gracefully. This ensures that errors are reported, allowing for appropriate error handling and improved application stability.  The solution also includes more robust error logging for debugging purposes.
